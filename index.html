  <h2>Set Your Text to a Comfortable Measure</h2>

  <p>
    According to Robert Bringhurst in his book <cite>The Elements of Typographic Style</cite>:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Anything from 45 to 75 characters is widely regarded as a satisfactory length of line for a
      single-column page set in a serifed text face in a text size. The 66-character line (counting
      both letters and spaces) is widely regarded as ideal. For multiple-column work, a better
      average is 40 to 50 characters (p. 26).
    </p>
  </blockquote>

<section id="character-ranges">
  <h3>From 45 to 75 Characters</h3>
  <p>
    This is a line of text that is 45 characters. This: 55; here: 65. On to 75.
    This line, too, perfectly fits 45 characters. And it continues on until 75.
  </p>

  <h3>The Ideal Length: 66 Characters</h3>
  <p>
    And here is a line that reaches the ideal length of 66 characters.
    Another line following also reaches exactly all the way out to 66.
    Remember, all browsers collapse any whitespace in the HTML source.
  </p>

  <h3>Multi-column Line Lengths</h3>
  <p>
    Multi-column lines should strive for 40. Maybe 50.
    The goal: keep your readers comfortable. Be fussy.
    A grid’s adjacent columns produces such a setting;
    the same is true for CSS’s multi-columns property,
    which allows text to flow across multiple columns.
    (Grid constrains text to a single column and row.)
  </p>

<section id="caveats">
  <h3>Some Important Caveats</h3>
  <p>
    Note that spaces are included in those lines. We call the length of a page’s lines of text its
    <em>measure</em>. Generally speaking, the longer the lines of text—that is, the greater their
    measure—the more generously we should apply line-height, also known as <em>leading</em>.
  </p>

<section id="media-queries">
  <h3>Discover Your Media Queries</h3>
  <p>
    When building a responsive design, always start from the smallest possible viewport that you can
    display. As you pull the viewport open, using something like the Responsive Design Mode in
    Firefox, you will begin to see places where your page layout and its elements begin to exhibit
    signs of stress: lines of text get too long to read comfortably. Images occupy too much space.
    The page loses its hierarchy and readers’ eyes are no longer properly guided through the content
    of the page.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s at those signs of stress that you need to make an adjustment to your typesetting, by
    increasing the size of the text, or to your layout: either by dropping in a
    <code>min-width</code> media query expressed in ems, or by cleverly specifying a CSS Grid that
    handles larger screens and additional space for your layout.
  </p>
</section>
<section id="text-first">
  <h3>Set Your Text First</h3>
  <p>
    All of this advice depends on carefully set text. Again, mobile-first design is your best
    friend: get your typefaces chosen and set in a simple, single column (which is all there's
    really room for in the smallest mobile-scale views). You want your text size to be well
    established before braving the world of larger viewports, media queries, grid layout, and so on.
